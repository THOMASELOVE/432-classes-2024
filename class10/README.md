## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 4](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/lab4.html) is due Tuesday 2024-02-20 at noon.
2. A bonus question for Quiz 1 is **now** available on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/). Look for the **Quiz 1 Bonus Question: "How to be a modern scientist"** post (it's #40). Responses are due to [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) by the time the Quiz is due, which is Tuesday 2024-02-27 at noon. The bonus question will be worth approximately 3 points for a complete and well-written response, with some partial credit available.

## Finally...

[Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), in which I play Christopher Belling, is going well. If you'd like to go, please visit <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/> to reserve your tickets, but act quickly. There are a few seats left for the evening shows on February 23 and 24. All other performances are sold out. If you're coming to the show, hang around in the lobby afterwards for a few moments to meet the cast, if you like.

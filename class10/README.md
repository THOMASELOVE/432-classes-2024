## Announcements

1. To come.
 
## Finally...

[Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), in which I play Christopher Belling, is going well. If you'd like to go, please visit <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/> to reserve your tickets, but act quickly. There are a few seats left for the evening shows on February 23 and 24. All other performances are sold out. If you're coming to the show, hang around in the lobby afterwards for a few moments to meet the cast, if you like.

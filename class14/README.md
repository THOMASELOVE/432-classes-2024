## Announcements

1. We'll discuss Quiz 1 today in class. An answer sketch will be provided by class time.

## Time to Event Data

Materials on time-to-event outcomes are found in Chapters 29-31 of our [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-notes/). This is a very brief introduction to the topic, and we will continue to discuss survival analysis and Cox regression in classes 21 and 22 of this course. My department also offers a full-semester course (PQHS 435) every spring in Survival Analysis, which goes into much more detail.

- I also recommend [this PDF guide by David Diez on Survival Analysis in R from OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/book/surv_in_r/), which provides the `OISurv` package.
- I strongly recommend you look at the (7-minute) video "[Survival Curves: Showing More by Showing Less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoIB_Obddrk)" on YouTube posted by Frank Harrell, which explains the logic behind several tools in the `rms` package which let you interact with a graph and a non-parametric survival function which saves a little more information than the usual Kaplan-Meier plot.
- The **survminer** package is where you can find the **ggsurvplot** approach we'll take today. 
- For more customization of plots like the Kaplan-Meier curves we'll build today, visit <https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/survminer/> or <https://github.com/kassambara/survminer/>. 
    - For instance, they provide a [PDF cheat sheet](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/survminer/survminer_cheatsheet.pdf) which was pretty helpful to me.
- You may also be interested in learning more about concordance in survival analysis (and in general) [from this vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/vignettes/concordance.pdf) (pdf).

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 5](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/lab5.html) is due Tuesday 2024-03-05 at noon.
2. The [Project A portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/projA.html) is due **Monday** 2024-03-18 at noon (immediately after Spring Break.)
3. Now is also a good time to work on [Lab 8](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/lab8.html).

## One Last Thing

To come.

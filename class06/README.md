5. **Next Week** My plan for 432 [Class 07](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2024/tree/main/class07) and [Class 08](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2024/tree/main/class08) is to teach them live but over Zoom.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. Complete reading Jeff Leek's book "[How to be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist)" if you haven't already done so.
2. [Lab 3](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/lab3.html) is due Tuesday 2024-02-06 at noon.
3. It is **definitely** time to be working on your [Project A Plan](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/projA.html) which is due **Monday** 2024-02-12 at Noon. I would definitely aim to have my data for the project in R before next week, so you can spend next week working on getting the [Project A Plan](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/projA.html#the-project-a-plan) completed.
    - If you want to run a data set past us for Project A before going too far in the wrong direction, please follow [the instructions here](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/projA.html#running-a-data-set-past-us-for-project-a).

## And, finally...

Tickets to [Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), in which I play Christopher Belling, are going very quickly. While the show opens this weekend, I won't be in it because of COVID. The performances I will be in are February 9-11, 16-18 and 23-24, but the two Sunday matinees are already sold out. If you'd like to go, please visit <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/>, and get your tickets soon!

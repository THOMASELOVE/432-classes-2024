## And, finally...

Tickets to [Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), in which I play Christopher Belling, are going very quickly. While the show opens this Friday night, I won't be in it because of COVID, The performances I will be in are February 9-11, 16-18 and 23-24, but the two Sunday matinees are already sold out. If you'd like to go, please visit <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/>, and get your tickets soon!

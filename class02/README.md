- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record every 432 class via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas.

## One Last Thing

![](figures/snowtilesTwitter.png)

[Origin and development of a Snowflake Map](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/snow-tiles-demo/) by Althea Archer (posted 2023-01-11) provides reproducible R code demonstrating the evolution of a recent data visualization of snow cover in the continental United States. This work is a product of the USGS (United States Geological Survey) - the nation's largest water, earth and biological science and civilian mapping agency.

I learned about this work from [this post at FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/2023/01/17/snow-cover-mapped-using-snowflakes/).

## Shameless Promotion

I'm playing Christopher Belling in the musical [Curtains, at Hudson Players](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing) which runs February 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, 2024 at 8 PM Fridays and Saturdays and 2 PM for the two Sunday shows. Please come if you're interested. Tickets [are available here](https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?ticketing=hudpl). Remember, though, attending or not attending a show I'm in is 100% up to you, and carries no weight with me professionally. Thanks, and I hope to see you there!

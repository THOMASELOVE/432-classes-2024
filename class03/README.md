03 | 2024-01-23 | **[Slides 03](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2024/slides03.html)** | **[Code 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-slides-2024/blob/main/slides03.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record every 432 class via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas.

## Announcements

1. There was a small problem (repeated text in Chapter 4) with the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2024/), and it's now corrected, as of this morning.
2. We expect to add a TA (and thus, additional TA office hours) in time for this weekend.
3. Please complete the [Minute Paper after Class 3](https://bit.ly/432-2024-min-03) after today's class.
    - It's due at noon tomorrow (Wednesday 2024-01-24) and you should complete it regardless of whether you attend class in person, or watch the Zoom recording.

## On Using AI in this course

If you decide to use some sort of AI to help you with a Lab, we ask that you place a note to that effect, as a separate section, just before your presentation of Session Information. We've adjusted the Lab instructions for each Lab (1-7) to make this clear. Thank you. We've also adjusted (similarly) the Project instructions (for both Project A and Project B.) The use of AI to help in answering Quiz questions is not permitted.

## Self-Promotion

Tickets to [Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), in which I play Christopher Belling, are going very quickly. If you'd like to go, please visit <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/>. The show runs February 2-24 on the weekends. It would give me great joy to see you there!

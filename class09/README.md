## Announcements

1. We're back to in-person education today at 1 PM in our usual room E321-323 Robbins Hall.
2. I've posted a slightly revised version of the Lab 3 sketch to our Shared Drive, where I've augmented the rubric for Questions 3 and 5.
3. The [Minute Paper after Class 9](https://bit.ly/432-2024-min-09) is due Wednesday 2024-02-14 at noon. You'll find it at <https://bit.ly/432-2024-min-09>. Please complete it on time.

## Finally...

[Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), in which I play Christopher Belling, is going well. If you'd like to go, please visit <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/> to reserve your tickets, but act quickly. There are a few seats left for the evening shows on February 23 and 24. All other performances are sold out. If you're coming to the show, hang around in the lobby afterwards for a few moments to meet the cast, if you like, although I know it's a long show.

## Announcements

1. Today's class (and Class 08, on Thursday) will be held via Zoom. See your email or Canvas for log-in instructions.
2. As of now, I'm caught up on emails from students, and on Campuswire. Sorry for the lengthy delays last week.
3. The [Minute Paper after Class 07](https://bit.ly/432-2024-min-07) is due Wednesday 2024-02-07 at noon. The link is <https://bit.ly/432-2024-min-07>.
4. I have posted a Google Sheet to our Shared Drive called "Course Grading Roster for 432 in Spring 2024."
    - Posted there are grades and feedback on (in separate tabs of the sheet) Lab 1 and Lab 2, along with your grades on the Welcome to 432 survey (which everyone did) and the Minute Papers.
    - The grades are identified for each student by a three-digit Lab Code, which I will send out to you via email after class today.
5. [Lab 3](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/lab3.html) was due at noon today. As of 12:01 PM, I have submissions on Canvas from 34 of our 39 registered students. As for the rest of you, please get the Lab submitted to Canvas as soon as possible. We will post the answer sketch at noon on Wednesday 2024-02-07.

## And, finally...

I will finally get to appear in [Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), starting this weekend. I play Christopher Belling, as mentioned previously. The show continues for the next three Friday and Saturday evenings with two Sunday matinees. This weekend's performances are within 2-3 tickets of completely selling out, as is the Sunday matinee on February 18, but there are definitely seats available for our evening performances on February 16, 17, 23 and 24! If you'd like to go, please visit <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/> and act quickly, as the show will soon come close to selling out those remaining performances.

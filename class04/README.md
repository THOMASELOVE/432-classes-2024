## Today's Slides

Class | Date | HTML | Quarto .qmd | Recording
:---: | :--------: | :------: | :------: | :-------------:
04 | 2024-01-25 | **[Slides 04](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-slides-2024/slides04.html)** | **[Code 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-slides-2024/blob/main/slides04.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record every 432 class via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas.

## More to come.

Still to include:

1. Feedback on Minute Paper after Class 3
2. Progress on this issue from Class 3 "Printing the slides to PDF can be a little unsatisfying - sometimes material is cut off. It seems that the settings I'm using for our slides don't let you easily "write" on them to take additional notes. I can add some functionality there, according to Quarto, but it may limit your ability to download the slides, so I'll need to experiment a bit. I'll try to work something out for Class 4 and beyond."
3. New TA announcement

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/lab2.html) due Tuesday 2024-01-30 at Noon.
2. Continue reading [How To Be A Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist) (so you're done by next Thursday's class.)

## From [On the 12th Day of Christmas, a Statistician Sent to Me...](https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj-2022-072883)

> To elicit the most common issues encountered during statistical peer review, an internal survey was administered to The BMJâ€™s statistical editors. Twelve items were identified, and each are described here. There is one item for each of the 12 days of Christmas, the period between 25 December and 5 January when the statisticians conduct their reviews in the mindset of the Grinch, but with the kind heart of *Miracle On 34th Street*.

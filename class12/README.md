## Quiz 1

1. [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-quizzes-2024/tree/main/quiz1) will be made available by 5 PM today.
2. Don't forget that the bonus question for Quiz 1 is **now** available on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/). Look for the **Quiz 1 Bonus Question: "How to be a modern scientist"** post (it's #40). Responses are due to [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) by the time the Quiz is due. The bonus question will be worth either 3 or 4 points for a complete and well-written response, with some partial credit potentially available.

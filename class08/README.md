- To print the HTML slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.

## The recording was paused for part/all of the session, so after it was over, I redid the class in about 30 minutes, and that's the recording you'll find posted.

## Announcements

1. Today's class will again be given via Zoom. Check your email or [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) for the Zoom information.
2. By now, you should have received an email with your 432 Lab Code, and used it to view feedback and grades for Labs 1 and 2 (and the Minute Papers) on our Shared Drive in the Course Grading Roster. Let me know if you have trouble accessing this information.
    - If you'd like me to regrade one of the Labs, please read and follow [the Lab Appeal Policy from our Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2024/08-grading.html#lab-appeal-policy---request-a-review-via-google-form).
3. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 07 is available at <https://bit.ly/432-2024-min-07-feedback>.
4. The data set we'll use today in class is the Favorite Movies data from my 431 class this past Fall.
    - The data are [here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-classes-2024/blob/main/class08/movies_2023-10-24.xlsx) and on our 432-data page in downloadable Excel format.
    - Details on the Favorite Movies work from this Fall [can be found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2023/tree/main/movies).
    - You'll also find the complete data, including its Codebook, in a Google Sheet on our Shared Drive for this class.

## What Should I Be Working On?

The [Project A Plan](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/projA.html#the-project-a-plan), due **MONDAY** 2024-02-12 at Noon to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).

1. Please use [the Quarto template we provided for the Project A Plan](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/projA.html#templates) in preparing your work.
2. If you are working with a partner, all work must be submitted by exactly one of you to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) while the non-reporting partner submits a one-page note to Canvas indicating the members of the partnership and that the partner will submit the work.
3. Please be sure to submit the following items to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) by noon on **MONDAY** 2024-02-12.
    - a Quarto (.qmd) file containing one unnumbered, and 10 numbered sections
    - an HTML result of applying the Quarto "plan" file to your data which has a working table of contents
    - a copy of your (tidied) data (see Section 4.3 of the Project A Plan) in an .Rds file.

### My Two Best Pieces of Advice

1. Read over the information I've provided on [Project A Plan Contents](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/projA.html#project-a-plan-contents) and make sure you have all of those issues covered in what you submit.
2. Review your HTML output file carefully before submission for copy-editing issues (spelling, grammar and syntax.) Even with spell-check in RStudio (just hit F7), itâ€™s hard to find errors with these issues in your Quarto file so long as your Quarto file runs. You really need to look at the resulting HTML output, closely.

## And, finally...

Tickets to some performances of [Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), in which I play Christopher Belling, are still available. If you'd like to go, please visit <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/>. There are a few seats left for the evening shows on February 16 and 17, and reasonable availability on February 23 and 24. All other performances are sold out. If you're coming to the show, hang around in the lobby afterwards for a few moments to meet the cast, if you like!

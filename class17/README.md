## Announcements

1. There is a Minute Paper after Class 17 due Wednesday 2024-03-20 at noon. The link will appear **by class time**.
2. For those of you who have not yet submitted all of [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2024/projA.html) to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu), be aware of the following deadlines:
    - if all of your work is submitted between now and Wednesday 2024-03-20 at noon, you will lose 5 points (out of the 80 available for the post-proposal work.)
    - if all of your work is submitted between Wednesday at noon and Friday 2024-03-22 at 11:59 PM, you will lose 10 points.
    - and that's it. We won't accept work received after Friday at 11:59 PM.
3. Bonus credit for Project A will be awarded to all students who responded to Note #80 on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) by noon today. We'll share a few of those ideas in class Thursday.
4. I don't know when we'll get you feedback on Project A, but I'm aiming (tentatively) for the end of next week.
5. The [Project B proposal form](https://bit.ly/432-2024-projectB-proposal-form) will open on Thursday 2024-03-21, and we will also discuss Project B's instructions in class 18 (Thursday).
6. I've added [the **tidytext** package](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) to our list of R packages to install. We'll use a function from it in Class 25.
